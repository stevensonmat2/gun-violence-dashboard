                    The Gun Violence Dashboard was created to provide statics on gun violence worldwide,
                    with a focus on the United States. We chose this project because the issue of gun
                    violence continues to grow in our society, and we feel a tool to demonstrate the relationship
                    between gun policy and gun violence could be impactful.

                    The Homepage showcases a map of the United States where the fill of each State is determined
                    by average number of deaths due to firearms per 100,000 people. Users can see how this average
                    has changed over the years by selected from the year dropdown. When a user clicks on a state,
                    the state detail is filled with information such as: gun law grade, percentage of households with
                    a gun, and prohibited firearms/ammunition. Addtionally, there is a bar chart of the total number
                    of deaths per year.
